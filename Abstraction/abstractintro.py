#   interfaces are abstract classes
#   we can have methods in abstract class
#   which have implementation,
#   but at least one method should be abstract(which isnt implemented)
#    if all the methods are not abstract, then we can create an instance of that class which is not abstract


# for ex.,

#BMW    --  parent class(abstract)                #THREESERIES(BMW)  --  child class
#@abstractmethod                                  #drive() -  implementation
#drive():                                         #print('good speed')
#pass


#   in python, none of the methods of abstract class have implementation
